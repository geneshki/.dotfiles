dotfiles
========

This is my repository of dotfiles. Feel free to use.

config files
===========

The config.sh downloads every git repository that is listed in the config.properties
file. The destination folder is cited also in config.properties.

I am using this files to download pathogen and then all the plugins I need and use.
